Title : Uncovering Coffee Sales Trends: An Exploratory Data Analysis
Coffee dataset Analysis by (~ Ajay Borah )

ðŸ“Œ Context (for report or presentation)
This dataset contains transaction-level data from a coffee shop, including details such as date, time, product purchased, payment type, and revenue. By performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), we aim to uncover customer behavior patterns, sales trends, and business opportunities.

Understanding when and how customers purchase coffee helps answer key business questions such as:

Which days of the week generate the most revenue?

What are the peak business hours, and how can staffing be optimized?

Do customers who pay by cash vs. card spend differently?

Which coffee products are the top sellers?

Are there seasonal or monthly trends (e.g., hot drinks in winter, iced drinks in summer)?

These insights provide valuable guidance for:

Menu planning (e.g., stocking popular items),

Operational efficiency (e.g., scheduling staff during peak times),

Marketing strategies (e.g., targeted offers during slow periods),

Improving customer experience by understanding purchase habits
